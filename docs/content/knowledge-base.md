## 1. Geography & Environment

### Location
- Eastern Varaždin County, borders Međimurje and Koprivnica-Križevci counties
- Podravina lowlands near Bednja-Plitvica-Drava confluence
- 10 km from Ludbreg (main road connection)
- No direct bridge to Međimurje (isolated position)

### Rivers
- **Bednja**: Drains Zagorje hills, prone to overflow on flat plain
- **Plitvica**: Flows through Dubovica (splits village into upper/lower), joins Drava
- **Drava**: Southern boundary, historically provided fish and driftwood

### Soil & Terrain
- Heavy clay-loam ("ilovača") - fertile but floods easily
- High water table (1m to groundwater in some areas)
- Network of drainage canals transforms swamp to farmland
- Local saying: "We have gold under our feet" (soil quality)

### Climate Challenges
- Severe flooding risk (worst in 40 years occurred mid-2010s)
- Thick autumn/winter fog ("Podravska magla")
- Hailstorms - May 2022 supercell destroyed 50% of Croatia's flower production
- "Sjeverac" north wind in winter
- Local saying: "Drava daje, Drava uzima" (Drava gives, Drava takes)

### Flood Response Culture
- Distrust of Hrvatske vode (state water management)
- Kapela residents once cut road embankment themselves to create emergency spillway
- "Sandbag brigade" mobilizes faster than government
- Many households keep motor pumps for cellar defense
- St. John Nepomuk statue (1764) at crossroads - patron against floods

## 4. Demographics

### Population Trajectory
| Year | Kapela | Trend |
|------|--------|-------|

| 1869 | 503 | Growth (stability) |
| 1900 | 558 | Recovery |
| 1921 | 555 | Post-WWI (peak era ~2,143 total municipality) |

| 2011 | 466 | Sharp decline |
| 2021 | 408 | Return to 1857 levels |

### Key Patterns
- Full demographic cycle: 1857 levels → peak → back to 1857
- Population peaked over 100 years ago (not recent decline)
- Dubovica lost half its population (420 in 1971 → ~250 now)
- Age structure skews old (median ~mid-40s even in "youngest" Kapela)
- Young families few - newborns countable on one hand some years

### Migration Waves
1. **1960s-70s Gastarbeiter**: Young men to Germany, Austria, Switzerland
2. **Domestic industrial**: Daily commute to Ludbreg/Varaždin factories
3. **Post-1990**: Education in city → no return (limited professional jobs)
4. **Post-EU 2013**: Exodus to Ireland, Germany for work

### Return Migration
- Mostly retirement-aged (German pensioners with renovated homes)
- Children usually stay abroad
- Few entrepreneurial returnees (take over family OPG)

### Irony
- "Mali" (small) Bukovec actually larger (~1,800) than "Veliki" (big) Bukovec (~1,325)

## 5. Economy

### Traditional Base
- Subsistence farming (corn, wheat)
- Estate labor under Drašković
- Forestry (Križančija oak/beech valuable)
- Milling (Dubovica had Plitvica mill)

### Modern Pillars

#### 1. Wood Processing
- **Požgaj Group** (Veliki Bukovec): Major employer, flooring/furniture components
- **Pilana Pečenec** (Kapela): Sawmill operation
- Builds on forestry tradition and local timber resources

#### 2. Floriculture (Signature Industry)
- Started late Yugoslav period, exploded around 2000s
- Known as "centar hrvatske proizvodnje cvijeća" (center of Croatian flower production)
- 50% of Croatia's flower production concentrated here
- Products: Chrysanthemums, geraniums, bedding plants
- Markets: Zagreb (Kvatrić, Trešnjevka)
- Investment: Imported soil (Lithuania), greenhouses, heating
- Risk: 2022 hail destroyed "30 years of work in 15 minutes"
- Key families: Mađarić (Kapela), numerous Dubovica growers

#### 3. Family Farms (OPG)
- "Jaka cvjećarska proizvodnja po OPG-ovima" (strong production on family farms)
- Higher yield per hectare than corn
- Allows small fragmented holdings to remain viable
- Requires technical sophistication and logistics

### Side Economies
- Rakija (brandy) production - informal sales, 1980s fame at Varaždin markets
- Construction work abroad (1980s) - savings invested in farms
- Cottage industry (basket weaving, coopering)
- Seasonal migrant farmhand work

### What Failed
- No large factory established locally
- Castle never became tourist attraction
- EU-funded projects (refrigeration hub, biofuel) didn't materialize
- Tech/heavy industry never took root

### Employment Pattern
- Many dual-income: Factory job + farm
- Veliki Bukovec: Most diversified (factory, school, municipality, farming)
- Kapela: Hybrid of farming and entrepreneurship
- Dubovica: Almost entirely agriculture/floriculture
